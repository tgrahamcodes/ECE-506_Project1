# ECE506 Project — Networking Mathematics in MATLAB

## Overview
This project involves implementing mathematical models and simulations related to **networking concepts** using MATLAB. The program runs calculations and visualizations to analyze different aspects of network performance.

## Features
- Implements mathematical models for networking analysis.
- Uses **MATLAB** for computation and visualization.
- Supports configurable parameters for simulations.

## Prerequisites
- MATLAB installed on your system.
- Basic understanding of networking mathematics.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository/ECE-506_Project1.git
   cd ECE-506_Project1
   ```
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the project directory.

## Usage
Run the main script in MATLAB:
```matlab
main
```
This executes the primary computations and displays relevant outputs.

## Implementation Details
- `main.m`: The primary script containing all computations.
- Uses MATLAB’s built-in functions for mathematical operations.
- Supports modification for different networking scenarios.

## Example Output
Depending on the networking model used, the output could include:
- Graphs and plots for network performance.
- Numerical results for data transmission calculations.

## Additional Notes
- Ensure all required MATLAB toolboxes are installed.
- Modify the script to adjust parameters for different scenarios.
